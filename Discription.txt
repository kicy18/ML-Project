Movie Recommendation System
Welcome to the Movie Recommendation System project! This project leverages the power of machine learning to recommend movies based on similarity metrics. Below you'll find details on the tools and libraries used, along with a brief overview of the project's functionalities.

Project Overview
The Movie Recommendation System is designed to provide movie recommendations to users based on the similarity of movies. The project is implemented using Jupyter Notebook for data processing and analysis, and Streamlit for creating an interactive web application.

Technologies and Libraries
Python: The core programming language used for the entire project.
Jupyter Notebook: Used for data processing, analysis, and model development.
Streamlit: A powerful library for building interactive web applications in Python.
Pandas: Essential for data manipulation and analysis.
NumPy: Used for numerical operations.
NLTK: Utilized for natural language processing, specifically for stemming.
Scikit-learn: Used for vectorization and calculating the similarity between movies.
Project Components
1. Data Processing
Pandas: Used to load and manipulate the movie dataset.
NLTK: Employed for stemming movie descriptions to standardize the text data.
2. Vectorization and Similarity Calculation
TF-IDF Vectorization: Converts text data into numerical format using term frequency-inverse document frequency.
Cosine Similarity: Measures the cosine of the angle between two non-zero vectors to determine similarity.
3. Interactive Web Application
Streamlit: Creates a user-friendly web interface where users can input a movie title and receive a list of similar movies.
